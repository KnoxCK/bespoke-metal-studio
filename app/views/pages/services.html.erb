			<p>We believe that because our manufacturing processes are either in-house or local to us, we are able to keep a tight control over time, cost and quality unlike many of our competitors. This is extremely important to us so we aim to keep you updated on progress at each step of the way and involved in the production process as much as possible. We have been working with the majority of our suppliers for more than 5 years and they share our emphasis on exceptional quality and strict timeframes.</p>

			<p>At Bespoke Metal Studio we specialise in metalwork and therefore are delighted to take on any project that has metal involved in the design, be it brass, steel, stainless steel, aluminium or copper. However, we also work with stone, glass, fabrics and many exotic materials that can be applied to our designs as, for example, decorative inlays, light shades or diffusers.</p>

We also offer nickel plating, powder coating, any RAL code painting and lacquered finishes. Our glass suppliers offer different textures, colours and effects, as well as clear or frosted finishes. We are happy to take a sample you may have, for instance a lamp shade, fabric sample or metal finish, and match it to create our own samples for your approval.</p>

			<p>When it comes to delivery and installation, we will always adapt to your needs. We often liaise with  site managers and electricians on-site to ensure all requirements are fulfilled, providing them with technical specifications as well as installation and maintenance instructions. We can arrange packaging and delivery for you worldwide or deliver the products ourselves if the project is in London. Alternatively, we offer a full service which includes installation within the package – our team will visit the site, ensuring access is feasible, checking fixings and fittings in ceilings and walls and planning the installation thoroughly.</p>
